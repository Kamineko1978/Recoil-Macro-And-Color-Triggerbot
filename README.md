# Recoil-Macro-And-Color-Triggerbot

Created this with the intention to better understand Windows mouse functions, as well as bitmaps and how they can be used.

This project includes:

 - A Customizable recoil macro which works in any game
 - A Pixel Triggerbot (checks the color of a pixel on screen, and if the color changes I click the left mouse button)
 - A Config system so you can save settings that you have set (stored in JSON files)
